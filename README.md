# Advent of Code Solutions

Recently I've enjoyed doing Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) as my outlet for "recreational coding", and trying out new C# language features free from the constaints of a legacy codebase. I am not aiming to solve thes puzzles on the daily schedule, just whenever I have the time/inclination for some fun hacking. Inspored by Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), I find notebooks are an elegant means to solve these puzzles in a descriptive [literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style. 

Given I'm using C#, my notebook engine of choice is [.NET Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive), via the [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) VS Code extension.

The Advent of Code [About](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) page kindly requests to _not_ include puzzle text in any published solutions. I like to save the puzzle text within my notebooks as sometimes I work on these puzzles on plane trips with no internet access. Therefore this repo represents the "published" edition of my notebooks, where the puzzle text has been replaced with a link to the puzzle description of the Advent of Code website.
