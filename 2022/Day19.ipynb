        "So this one turned out to be the first puzzle to give us some real showstopping challenges, in particular how to reduce the computation time given such a massive search space. There\u0027s a few intuitive tricks that immediately jump out, for instance, in the second-last minute, the only viable option is to build a geode robot if possible, since anything else will not contribute an additional geode in the last minute. But unfortunately we can\u0027t continue this working-backwawrds approach like a typical dynamic programming puzzle, as the exact number of resources are not known. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another intuition is that it makes no sense to just build ore and clay robots the whole time- you need to be making progress towards the goal. So we need some way to measure our progress and we can use that to prune unproductive branches. The first approach I tried is to compare states - that is, if one state has $m$ ore, $n$ ore robots, etc, then another state is considered worse if it has $\u003C= m$ ore, $\u003C= n$ robots, etc, for all resources and robots. I tried using this to prune branches that achieved lesser states, but it didn\u0027t yield the performance I was looking for.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually, I asked an LLM to give me some hints. The key hint that unlocked a solution for me was to use a _theoretical best_ geode count as a progress measure. That is, assuming we could build a geode robot every minute for every remaining minute, how many geodes could we theoertically obtain? We can compare this theoretical geode count agains our best _actual_ geode count, and discard any paths that cannot theoretically improve upon our best. At this point I also switched to a depth-first search of the problem space, to help find an initial solution as quickly as possible and allow the pruning to take effect."
